This is my Brawl Stars Tracker made in SvelteKit, it is optimized for Mobile because I didn't know how to do a good UI design for Desktop. If you want to try it on your own, download this repo and do ```npm run dev``` then go to 127.0.0.1/account?id=yourbrawlstarsid It still takes a while to load but I am working on it.
